TPS-1:
    4.  Machine instructions in MIPS contain 32 bits.
    5.  There are 3 main instruction formats in MIPS: R-type (Register), I-type (Immediate), and J-type (Jump).
    6.  A.  he instruction on line 7 (slt $t0, $s1, $s0) is an R-type instruction. It has 6 fields: opcode (6 bits), rs (5 bits), rt (5 bits), rd (5 bits), shamt (5 bits), funct (6 bits).
        B.  Opcode (6 bits) = 0x00
            rs = $s1 = 0x11
            rt = $s0 = 0x10
            rd = $t0 = 0x08
            shamt = 0x00
            funct = 0x2a (opcode for slt)
        C.  Binary: 0000000001000101000010000100000000101010
            Hex: 0x01288a2a
    7.  A.  Machine code at 0x00400010 is 0x00098a2a
        B.  This is an R-type instruction (opcode 0x00). R-type has 6 fields: opcode, rs, rt, rd, shamt, funct.
        C.  Opcode = 0x00
            rs = 0x09
            rt = 0x08
            rd = 0x0a
            shamt = 0x00
            funct = 0x2a
        D.  This is the slt instruction. rs = $t1, rt = $t0, rd = $t2
        E.  The instruction is: slt $t2, $t1, $t0
    8.  A.  The instruction on line 17 (bne $t0, $zero, LESS) is an I-type instruction.
        B.  Opcode = 0x05 (opcode for bne)
            rs = $t0 = 0x08
        C.  The target label is LESS. Its address is 0x00400020.
        D.  No, we cannot put the full address in the immediate field as it is only 16 bits wide.
        E.  We calculate the offset by: (Target Address - PC + 4) / 4
            offset = (0x00400020 - 0x00400014 + 4) / 4 = 4
            So immediate = 0x0004
        F.  Binary: 0000010000001000000000000000 0100
            Hex: 0x15080004
    9.  A.  The j instruction is a J-type instruction with only 2 fields - opcode (6 bits) and address (26 bits)
        B.  Opcode for j is 0x02
        C.  The label is END and its address is 0x00400030
        D.  The address field is 26 bits wide. The full 32-bit address is shifted 2 bits to the right (divided by 4) and the lower 28 bits are taken.
            Value in address field = 0x00400030 >> 2 = 0x01000018
        E.  Binary: 000010 00000000000000000001000000011000
            Hex: 0x08000018
