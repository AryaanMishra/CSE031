Assignment 1:

	1. The segmentation error is caused by line 18, 'scanf("%d, input);'. "input" is an int while it should have been a pointer instead.
	2. To fix the segmentation fault, we have to change 'scanf("%d, input);' to 'scanf("%d, &input);'
    	3. As the "sum" parameter for the read_value function is a double, any changes made to it doesn't affect the sum variable in the main function. Therefore, the sum always remains zero.
    	4. To fix this issue, we have to change the parameter of the read_value function, from sum to a pointer to sum instead.
