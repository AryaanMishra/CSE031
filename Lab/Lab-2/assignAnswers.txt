Assignment 1:

	1. The segmentation error is caused by line 18, 'scanf("%d, input);'. "input" is an int while it should have been a pointer instead.
	2. To fix the segmentation fault, we have to change 'scanf("%d, input);' to 'scanf("%d, &input);'
    	3. As the "sum" parameter for the read_value function is a double, any changes made to it doesn't affect the sum variable in the main function. Therefore, the sum always remains zero.
    	4. To fix this issue, we have to change the parameter of the read_value function, from sum to a pointer to sum instead. 

Assignment 2:
    
    1. No, the output is not expected as there are some unexpected characters in the output, "HELLO!hello!@." 
    2. No, this output is not expected either, "HI!hi!hello!@." This time the strings has the output from the last output and additional characters from memory.To fix these issue, we have to add a null terminator in the append function, this takes care of the unexpected characters being printed from memory.
    3. No, it's not the expected output, "thank you!I am fine, thank you!|." This happens because the program limits the size of str1 and str2 to only 10 characters, entering longer strings lead to a buffer overflow. For the buffer overflow issue, we simply have to allocate more meory size to str1 and str2.
