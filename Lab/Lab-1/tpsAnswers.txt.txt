	Initialize odd, even, evenCount, oddCount to 0

	While True:

    		Prompt the user to enter a number
    		Read the input number

    		If the number is 0
			break the loop

    		Calculate the sum of digits in the number

    		If the sum of digits is even:
        		Add the number to even
        		Increment evenCount by 1
    		Else:
        		Add the number to odd
        		Increment oddCount by 1

	If evenCount is not 0
		calculate avgEven as even divided by evenCount

	If oddCount is not 0 
		calculate avgOdd as odd divided by oddCount

	Print avgEven and avgOdd
